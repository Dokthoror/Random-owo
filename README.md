## Can I add eyes and mouthes for future generated owo

Of course you can ! Just add eyes and mouthes in the **EYES** and **MOUTHES** arrays like this :

```bash
EYES=('o' 'O' 'è é' 'é è' '°' 'V' 'T' 'u' 'U' 'o O' 'O o' 'w' 'W' 'p p' '- -')
MOUTHES=('w' '_' '>' '<' 'ω' 'u' '-' 'O' '0')
```

If both eyes have to be identical, just put one, either, put two of them with a space character between.
